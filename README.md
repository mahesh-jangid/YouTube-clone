### YouTube Clone

  A direct clone of the popular video hosting and viewing site, YouTube.

### Description

  This web app is a clone of the site YouTube and made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the YouTube Data API v3. On here, we are able to search for 
  any videos and see these videos. Also we can see some related videos of searched query videos. The goal of this project was to clone YouTube as closely and as         accurately as possible to showcase my ability to take a wireframe or template and translate that into a functioning and visually identical web app.

### Technologies Used
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript
